PLEASE NOTE: this theme is a work in progress. Dave is currently working to update the theme to be compatible in ExtJS 3.0, and to add in new features. There is still a lot left to do, but if you run across bugs or things you need sooner rather than later, then please contact dave at dsanders@opensoftco.com or on the ExtJS forums under the account Dave.Sanders.
